# Dee-Flickz website

## Description

This project is a portfolio website I'm building for a close friend who is a cinematographer. He creates videos for events, parties, sports, and even fashion brands. The goal of this site is to design a clean, visually engaging UI that highlights his work, story and also book with him.

## Design

I designed the layout in Figma, with a **mobile-first approach** since most of his clients discover him through Instagram.
