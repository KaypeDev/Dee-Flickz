# Dee-Flickz website

## Description

This project is a portfolio website I'm building for a close friend who is a cinematographer. He creates videos for events, parties, sports, and even fashion brands. The goal of this site is to design a clean, visually engaging UI that highlights his work, story and also book with him.

## Design

I designed the layout in Figma, with a **mobile-first approach** since most of his clients discover him through Instagram.

## Progress

- **8/8/25:** Folder Structure, Tailwindcss and Framer Motion Install, and built Navbar and Hero section for Home.
- **8/12/25** Finished the whole Homepage, no footer yet, made sure all the section also looked good on mobile.
